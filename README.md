# My GitHub pages 
## Pages I have created so far:

### [Calculator](https://simontitk.github.io/)
A simple calculator app written with HTML, CSS and JS. Equation parsing done by the math.js library. Considering impelementing an abstract syntax tree in the future.


### [The Bald Mountain](https://simontitk.github.io/the_bald_mountain)
A map of our favorite hiking trails at the Bald Mountain (*Kopasz-hegy*), Hungary. It displays some pictures we have taken at different locations throughout the years. Some of the locations we named, others are from the local folklore. Regardless, all of them sound weird translated to English.
The map is created using the Folium library in `map.py`, alongside with a minimal Flask server in `app.py`.
